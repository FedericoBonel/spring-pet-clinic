# spring-pet-clinic

Re interpretation of the Spring Framework Pet Clinic Application to get a hold of Spring concepts. 
It's based on the original spring example aplication but it's changed in it's code and implementation. 
It could be seen as a refactor but I like to call it a re interpretation because it's a whole new development of the application.
